The analysis looks at student outcomes in reading and math in 15 different high schools.  Factors include school size, type (district or charter), and budget.

One correlation that I found surprising was that % Passing rates - for Math, Reading and Overall - all go down as the budget per student goes up.

Charter schools have consistently higher passing rates than District schools.  I might be assumed that it has to do with school size - Small and Medium sized schools out-performed Large schools by similar margins - however, there is 1 Large Charter school in the data and the passing rates for that school are just as high as the rest of the Charter schools that are smaller.
